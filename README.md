The following Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with more detailed information about the collection, processing and use of data in connection with our games offered as mobile applications.
BaMe collects, processes and uses personal data exclusively in accordance with the applicable legal regulations. Therefore, the high data protection level of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") applies.

1. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

1.1 This Privacy Policy is intended for all users of the Games Apps ("Users"). If certain services or individual apps of BaMe have a different data protection declaration, such declaration shall apply.

1.2 The scope of this Privacy Policy does not include services and offers of third parties that may be referred to in the Games App by so-called links. BaMe neither assumes responsibility for their content nor for compliance with data protection regulations by these third parties, unless otherwise stated in the privacy policy of the linked content. This applies, for example, to links via which social networks such as Facebook or chat apps such as WhatsApp can be accessed, and to links in advertisements that are played. For information on the handling of the User's personal data and their respective protection on these platforms, please refer to the privacy statement on the respective platform.

2. DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE GAMES APPS

2.1 When you download and install our Games Apps, the operator of the platform through which you obtain the respective app (for example Google Ireland Limited for the Google PlayStore) collects personal data required for the download. These data include in particular your name, your e-mail address and your postal code, time of download, the IP address and the individual device identification number of your device (so-called IMEI), as well as your payment information, if applicable. This collection and processing of your personal data is, however, basically carried out solely by the respective platform operator without our participation in the data processing or our ability to influence it. In this respect, the data protection provisions of the platform operator apply, which can be viewed on the platform in question. We only receive and process personal data collected by the platform operator to the extent necessary for the download and provision of the Games App. 

3. COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF DATA WHEN USING THE GAMES APPS

3.1 When you start and use BaMe's Games Apps, depending on the Games App, a connection may be automatically established to the servers used by us in order to retrieve current content. Information that your device transmits to us is logged in the process. This includes the IP address of the device you are using, data on the operating system used as well as the installed Games App and its version, date and time (including time zone) of the respective access to the contents of the Games App as well as the information on which specific contents have been requested for the respective Games App. In addition, BaMe may collect and process personal data in order to fulfil its contractual obligations with the User, e.g. to create the User's player profile. Depending on the respective Games App, this data includes name and IP address and data identifying the User's device.

3.2 BaMe collects and processes these data in order to provide the Games App and the respective current content of the Games App. The provision of these data is not required by law, but is necessary for the conclusion of the user contract for the respective Games App and the associated service by BaMe. 

3.3 Unity Ads/other advertisement provider may collect information of the User to provide appropriate ads to the User.

4. IN-APP PAYMENTS

4.1 In some Games Apps, we may offer certain additional versions and content for purchase, e.g. the use of an ad-free version of the app. In order to conclude the corresponding contract and the associated payment processing, it is necessary to enter bank details or other payment-related data (e.g. credit card). For payment processing, we use the services provided by the respective operator of the platform through which you have obtained the Games App (for example, Apple, Inc. for the AppStore and Google Ireland Limited for the Google PlayStore). The aforementioned information will be processed accordingly together with the necessary usage data by the operator of the respective platform, insofar as this is necessary to process the payment. Details on the handling of your personal data in connection with the payment processing can be found in the privacy statement of the respective platform operator which can be viewed on the corresponding platform.

4.2 The use of these payment services is mandatorily required by the platform operator in order for us to be allowed to offer the app on the respective platform and also serves to provide you with an easy and smooth payment process in the app.
